    <h2> Trouble Shooting/ FAQ </h2>
    <p>
      Q: I'm trying to save my background, but everytime I open a new page it goes back to the default gray. <br>
      A: Storage is currently limited to 5MB, so try clearing your broswer cache and scaling your resolution lower.  Make sure you have the "Allow local data to be set" setting on.  This is accessible in Settings > Show Advanced Settings > Contenet Settings.
    </P>
    <p>
      Q: Why isn't any weather showing up? <br>
      A: Don't forget to input your location using either "City, State" format or zip code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: How do I delete and move around bookmarks? <br>
      A: You can currently drag and drop bookmarks to the top corner to delete bookmarks.
        All bookmarks are stored in the "2Day's Bookmarks" folder autogenerated for you in "Other Bookmarks," so any further editing must be done
        in Google Chrome's bookmark manager.  Drag and drop to reorder is currently under development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Why should I bother using this chrome extension when there's already a bookmarks bar? <br>
      A: This chrome extension hopefully offers a better more minimalistic UI than the existing bookmarks bar, with the function to open an entire folder of
        bookmarks with a single click.  In addition, part of the idea was to also seperate the bookmarks that you know you'll use often from the bookmarks
        you marked with the intent on going back to look at it (months later after you've forgetten about it) that fill up your bookmarks bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: The UI looks too cramped and some elements are overlapping each other. <br>
      A: Trying zooming out to 80 or 90% and it'll look much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: How do I sign out of Google Calendar account and into a different account? <br>
      A: 2Day's New Tab Page currently uses an authentication flow that automatically logs in your default Google account.  To change your default account,
        sign out of all currently logged in accounts, log into your desired account first, and then the rest.  If you don't want to switch default
        accounts, you can also use google calendar's feature to add your secondary account's calendars to your primary account's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: The checkbox next to one of my calendars is missing. <br>
      A: The checkbox will not appear if your calendar's name is too long.  However, you can rename a calendar in the Google Calendar website and it should fix the issue.
